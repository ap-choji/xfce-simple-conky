# xfce-simple-conky
A very simple and clean conky
All you got to do is create a .conky folder in your home directory:



mkdir ~/.conky/
cd  ~/.conky/

-- git clone the files in this directory, or move them there if you have them in a diffrent directory.

git clone https://github.com/ap-nas/xfce-simple-conky/

Then:
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh 

Then set the start.sh script to autostart using the Session and startup manager.
